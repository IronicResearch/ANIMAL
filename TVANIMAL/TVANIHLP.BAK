 Turbo Vision User InterfaceÜ
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Welcome to the Turbo Vision user interface. The menu bar, status line,
and display windows are similar to ones you may have seen before with
either the Macintosh or MS-Windows operating systems. Most selections
may be operated intuitively via the mouse. Keyboard short-cuts are
also available, with keys typically corresponding to command name letters.

For example, the "File" menu may be pulled down by pressing ALT-F.
The ð menu for desk accessories is accessed by ALT-Spacebar.
The menu bar may be resumed via function key F10.

Press the ESC key, or click the window's close button (in the
upper left corner), to put this help screen away.

.topic Puzzle=1200
 Puzzle Ü
  ßßßßßßß
The puzzle window is a small game.  The object is to get the characters
to form the following pattern:

    A  B  C  D
    E  F  G  H
    I  J  K  L
    M  N  O

Clicking the mouse on a tile next to the empty space moves the tile
into the space.  Pressing one of the cursor keys (up, down, left, or
right arrow) moves a tile into the empty space in the direction
indicated by the cursor key. The move counter is updated every time
a tile is moved.

.topic Calculator=1400
 Calculator Ü
  ßßßßßßßßßßß
The calculator is a simple four-function calculator with add, subtract,
multiply, and divide.  To operate the calculator you can either use the
keyboard or press the buttons on the calculator with the mouse. The 'C'
key clears the calculator, the '' key will erase the last character
typed, and the 'ñ' key toggles the value from positive to negative (the
keyboard equivalent of 'ñ' is '_').

.topic Calendar=1300
 Calendar Ü
  ßßßßßßßßß
The calendar displays the current month, highlighting todays date. The
next and previous months can be viewed using the '+' or '-' keys
respectivly.  The mouse can also be used to change the month by pressing
the  or  icons.

.topic Memory=1500
 Memory
  ßßßßßß
Shows the memory available for display windows, graphics, intermediate
operations, etc.
(The memory for interpolating points is already accounted for,
with 2000 points = over 60 seconds of screen time.)



.topic FileNew=2200
 File | New
  ßßßßßßßßßß
New plot clears out all points in memory, and sets up for a new set of
plotting data. You may optionally specify the Screen Time in advance
of any other plotting operations here.

.topic FileOpen=2100
 File | Load
  ßßßßßßßßßßß
Load File loads a previously saved point-plotter file from disk, and
puts it into memory. (This over-writes any/all key-frame points and
interpolated points which may have been in memory.) The contents of
the file in ASCII text format are displayed in a window.

.topic FileSave=2300
 File | Save
  ßßßßßßßßßßß
Save File saves the plotted points from memory to a disk file.
Both the key-frame points and the interpolated points are saved
in the file. The default file format is in ASCII text.

.topic FileDos=2800
 File³DOS Shell Ü
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
With the DOS Shell command, you can leave the program temporarily
to perform a DOS command or run another program.

To return to this program, type EXIT at the DOS prompt.

.topic FileQuit=2900
 File³Quit Ü     (Alt-Q)
  ßßßßßßßßßß
The Quit command terminates this program and returns to MS-DOS.



.topic EditTime=3200
 Edit | Screen Time
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Edits the length of time to move through the plotted points.
This Screen Time will compute the equivalent number of video frames
for interpolating the the move.

 1 second of Screen Time = 30 Video Frames.
 1 second of Screen Time = 24 Film Frames.

This edit dialog window also selects {Tapers:EditTaper}
for computing the initial "ease-in" and final "ease-out" of the time base.

.topic EditTaper=3300
 Edit | Taper In/Out
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Tapers determine how much of the time to "ease-in" and "ease-out"
of the move. They affect the acceleration and deceleration of the
move as it appears in Screen Time, and will likewise affect the
motor operation when actually running the move in real-time.
Tapers In and Out are specified in terms of percentages
of the overall time base of the move. For instance, a long Taper In
would initially start in a move more slowly, whereas a long Taper Out
would finally end out a move more slowly.
The tapers initially default = 10% In and 10% Out.

.topic EditPlot=3100
 Edit | Key-Frame Points
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Edits the key-frame points initially plotted into memory.
Also edits the time base intervals for multiple-point moves
(3-point moves or greater).

 [  Edit  ] accepts the edited information.
 [  Quit  ] quits this dialog, edited or not.

The editing of the points is done numerically here.
To edit a value, highlight the current value in the dialog window,
and type in a new value. Highlighting may be done with the mouse,
or hot-keyed with the TAB key.

The editing of the time base intervals may only be performed on
key-frame points inbetween the first and last points of 3-point
moves or greater. By default, the inbetween key-frame points are
located at equal time intervals throughout the move. So editing
the time intervals will either "stretch" or "squeeze" the move
to hit the key-frame point earlier or later on.

A special Freeze Frame option is only intended for multiple-point
moves where an inbetween key-frame point is deliberately duplictaed
in order to freeze the motion in that time interval. (4-point moves
or greater.) By default, the interpolation (spline) curve will
attempt to "wiggle" through the duplicate points (for perfect fit),
but this back-and-forth adjustment is not acceptable for the
freeze frame move. The Freeze Frame option "forces" the curve to stand
still during the time interval.
 
.topic EditDisplay=3400
 Edit | Display Points
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Opens a window to numerically display all the interpolated points.
(Yes, that means every single one of them.)

Standard window scroll-bars and re-size functions are available
to look through the entire listing of points.

.topic EditGraphics=3500
 Edit | Graph Points
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Opens windows to graphically display the interpolated points.
A separate graph is generated to show the relationship of each axis
with respect to time.

The graphs are displayed roughly using the "text" characters compatible
with the Turbo Vision user interface. High-resolution graphs are also
available, but will not remain on the screen after returning to the
user interface.

The Position/Increments button option will display the graph as either
positions with respect to time, or the increments between positions with
respect to time (velocity profile).
  


.topic RunPlot=4100
 Run | Plot Points
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Runs the motors to Plot the key-frame points into memory. 
The motors may be run to any location at random. Once a position is
located, the coordinates for that position are plotted into memory.
These plotted coordinates determine the Key-Frame Points.

 [  Plot  ] plots the positions into memory.
 [  Quit  ] quits this dialog, plotted or not.

Upon entering this dialog window, the {Joystick:Joystick} is automatically
activated. Therefore the Joystick's pushbutton will act as a
remote control cue for plotting the points, like the Plot button.

It is entirely up to the user to decide how many key-frame points
to plot. A minimal 2-point move will always tend to appear linear,
no matter how much tapering is selected. A 3-point move or greater
allows curved moves by the selection of inbetween points. A 4-point
move or greater will allow freeze frames by duplicating the inbetween
points. (See {Edit | Plot:EditPlot} for handling freeze frames.)

.topic RunReal=4200
 Run | Real-Time
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Runs the interpolated move in real-time, according to the
selected Screen Time. There are many run-time options here:

 [  Run  ] runs the interpolated curve in real-time.
 [ Align ] aligns the move to either the start or end position.
 [Overide] overides the starting position with the Joystick.

The main difference between Run and Align is whether to move the motors
along the curve in real-time, or in a straight line at maximum speed.
A more subtle, yet important difference is that the real-time curve
will only move by "relative" coordinates, whereas Align will insure
positioning by "absolute" coordinates.
  
The Forward/Reverse button options will select which way through the
interpolated curve to move; ie, starting at the first key-frame point,
or the last key-frame point.

The Stop-Motion option will allow you to move through the curve
an increment at a time, from point to point. The Joystick's
pushbutton will act as a remote cue for incrementing through
the move here.

When Running the move in real-time (Continuous option), hitting any
key on the keyboard will immediately kill all motor motion.
Therefore the Spacebar is a good key to use as a "panic button" stop.
Otherwise, wait for the move to come to completion before continuing
with the program.

.topic RunAlign=4300
 Run | Alignment
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Runs the Alignment procedure for locating the motor axes'
reference positions. This procedure runs each of the motors
into a limit switch position, and then counts back to a
pre-determined mid-travel position. Once all selected axes are
aligned into these reference positions, they are zeroed there.
(The position coordinates = 0.)

Axes may be re-zeroed for adjusted alignment positions.
After the alignment procedure finishes, you may re-position any axis
with an Overide operation. Then you can use the [ Zero ] command
to re-zero the axis at the new alignment position. The alignment data
in the {Util | Alignment:UtilAlign} menu is updated automatically.

.topic Overide=4400
 Run | Overide
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Overides running of the motors using the {Joystick:Joystick}.
Each of the motors X,Y,Z, and R may selectively be de-activated via the
check-box buttons in the dialog window.
The current position coordinates (in terms of User Units) are
displayed in the dialog window. They are only valid when the
Joystick has released control of the motors, and the motors
have stopped moving.

.topic Joystick=4500
 Joystick
  ßßßßßßßßß
Runs the motors with the hand-held Joystick assembly.
The Joystick assembly acts as a remote control to the motion control
electronics. Therefore, either the Joystick or the computer may have
control of the motion control system, but not both at the same time.

One of the Joystick elements controls the X and Y axes.
The other one (closest to the interconnection cable) controls the Z and R
axes.

The red pushbutton switch provides remote "cues" for different
parts of the program. Most of the time it acts like an on/off switch
for grabbing and releasing control of the motors for Overide motion.
While in {Run | Plot:RunPlot},
it will also cue the computer to Plot the key-frame points.
While in {Run | Real-Time:RunReal},
it will optionally cue the computer to Run through the interpolated points.
Any time the computer recognizes any of these remote cues, you should
hear a beep.

.topic RunStop=4600
 Run | Stop-Motion
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Runs the interpolated move in stop-motion, according to the
selected Screen Time.

 [  Run  ] runs the interpolated curve in stop-motion.
 [ Align ] aligns the move to either the start or end position.
 [Overide] overides the starting position with the Joystick.

The Forward/Reverse button options will select which way through the
interpolated curve to move; ie, starting at the first key-frame point,
or the last key-frame point.

The Automatic/Single-Frame button will allow you to move through the curve
an increment at a time, with pauses inbetween frames.
The keyboard spacebar may be used as the single-frame advance button.

.topic RunGomo=4700
 Run | Go-Motion
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Runs the interpolated move in go-motion, according to the
selected Screen Time.

 [  Run  ] runs the interpolated curve in go-motion.
 [ Align ] aligns the move to either the start or end position.
 [Overide] overides the starting position with the Joystick.

The Forward/Reverse button options will select which way through the
interpolated curve to move; ie, starting at the first key-frame point,
or the last key-frame point.

The Automatic/Single-Frame button will allow you to move through the curve
an increment at a time, with pauses inbetween frames.
The keyboard spacebar may be used as the single-frame advance button.

but may be ignored for traditional {stop-motion:RunStop} or {go-motion:RunGoMo} modes.

Film Frame Rate = 24 FPS (frames per second).
Video Frame Rate = 30 FPS.
Custom Frame Rate = user selectable FPS.

A custom frame rate may be necessary to fudge the time base needed for
real-time motion for cameras being driven by external motors, like
the ThingM stop-motion camera control. Refer to the actual frame rate
selected on the camera device; eg, the 'SPD' value for ThingM.
