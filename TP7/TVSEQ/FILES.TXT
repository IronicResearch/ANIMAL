Files on Sequencer Disk:

The following files are provided on the PC Sequencer Disk for 
use with the ThingM Stop-Motion Cameral Control.

TVSEQ.EXE	= Sequencer program with graphical user interface
TVSEQHLP.HLP	= Help file for TVSEQ.EXE
*.SEQ		= Example Sequencer data file(s)

TESTSEQ.EXE	= Sequencer program with text console interface
TESTERM.EXE	= Modem Terminal program for testing ThingM

Pascal source code files are provided for the console test programs
TESTSEQ.EXE and TESTERM.EXE so that the user may be able to make their
own custom modifications. Some programming experience is recommended,
and a Turbo Pascal compiler from Borland International is required.

TESTERM.PAS	= main source code for TESTERM.EXE terminal program
TERMIO.PAS	= source module for terminal emulator
SIO.PAS		= source module for serial interface

TESTSEQ.PAS	= main source code for TESTSEQ.EXE sequencer file program
SEQFILE.PAS	= source module for sequencer file saving and loading
SEQIO.PAS	= source module for sequencer operations
THINGM.PAS	= source module for ThingM commands
MCPU.PAS	= source module for motion control communications
SIO.PAS		= source module for serial interface
CONIO.PAS	= source module for console user interface
TIMEX.PAS	= source module for timing routines
GLOBAL.PAS	= source module for global variables
SWITCHES.INC	= include file for compiler switches and options

Additional Turbo Pascal libraries from TurboPro are also provided to 
complete recompilation of the source code. Only binary TPU files 
(Turbo Pascal Units) are allowed to be redistributed, per license 
agreement for TurboPro.

TPCRT.TPU	= library unit for TurboPro console extensions
TPMOUSE.TPU	= library unit for TurboPro mouse interface
TPINT.TPU	= library unit for TurboPro interrupt routines
TPINLINE.TPU	= library unit used internally by other TurboPro TPUs
