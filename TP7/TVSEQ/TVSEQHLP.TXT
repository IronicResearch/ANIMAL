For example, the "File" menu may be pulled down by pressing ALT-F.
The ð menu for desk accessories is accessed by ALT-Spacebar.
The menu bar may be resumed via function key F10.

.topic EditPlot=3100
 Edit | Key-Frame Points
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Edits the key-frame points initially plotted into memory.
Also edits the time base intervals for multiple-point moves
(3-point moves or greater).

 [  Edit  ] accepts the edited information.
 [  Quit  ] quits this dialog, edited or not.

The editing of the points is done numerically here.
To edit a value, highlight the current value in the dialog window,
and type in a new value. Highlighting may be done with the mouse,
or hot-keyed with the TAB key.

The editing of the time base intervals may only be performed on
key-frame points inbetween the first and last points of 3-point
moves or greater. By default, the inbetween key-frame points are
located at equal time intervals throughout the move. So editing
the time intervals will either "stretch" or "squeeze" the move
to hit the key-frame point earlier or later on.

A special Freeze Frame option is only intended for multiple-point
moves where an inbetween key-frame point is deliberately duplictaed
in order to freeze the motion in that time interval. (4-point moves
or greater.) By default, the interpolation (spline) curve will
attempt to "wiggle" through the duplicate points (for perfect fit),
but this back-and-forth adjustment is not acceptable for the
freeze frame move. The Freeze Frame option "forces" the curve to stand
still during the time interval.
 
.topic EditTime=3200
 Edit | Screen Time
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Edits the length of time to move through the plotted points.
This Screen Time will compute the equivalent number of video frames
for interpolating the the move.

 1 second of Screen Time = 30 Video Frames.
 1 second of Screen Time = 24 Film Frames.

This edit dialog window also selects {Tapers:EditTaper}
for computing the initial "ease-in" and final "ease-out" of the time base.

.topic EditTaper=3300
 Edit | Taper In/Out
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Tapers determine how much of the time to "ease-in" and "ease-out"
of the move. They affect the acceleration and deceleration of the
move as it appears in Screen Time, and will likewise affect the
motor operation when actually running the move in real-time.
Tapers In and Out are specified in terms of percentages
of the overall time base of the move. For instance, a long Taper In
would initially start in a move more slowly, whereas a long Taper Out
would finally end out a move more slowly.
The tapers initially default = 10% In and 10% Out.

.topic EditDisplay=3400
 Edit | Display Points
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

Standard window scroll-bars and re-size functions are available

.topic EditGraphics=3500
 Edit | Graph Points
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

A separate graph is generated to show the relationship of each axis
with respect to time.

The graphs are displayed roughly using the "text" characters compatible
with the Turbo Vision user interface. High-resolution graphs are also
available, but will not remain on the screen after returning to the
user interface.

The Position/Increments button option will display the graph as either
positions with respect to time, or the increments between positions with
respect to time (velocity profile).

.topic RunPlot=4100
 Run | Plot Points
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Runs the motors to Plot the key-frame points into memory. 
The motors may be run to any location at random. Once a position is
located, the coordinates for that position are plotted into memory.
These plotted coordinates determine the Key-Frame Points.

 [  Plot  ] plots the positions into memory.
 [  Quit  ] quits this dialog, plotted or not.

Upon entering this dialog window, the {Joystick:Joystick} is automatically
activated. Therefore the Joystick's pushbutton will act as a
remote control cue for plotting the points, like the Plot button.

It is entirely up to the user to decide how many key-frame points
to plot. A minimal 2-point move will always tend to appear linear,
no matter how much tapering is selected. A 3-point move or greater
allows curved moves by the selection of inbetween points. A 4-point
move or greater will allow freeze frames by duplicating the inbetween
points. (See {Edit | Plot:EditPlot} for handling freeze frames.)

.topic RunReal=4200
 Run | Real-Time
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Runs the interpolated move in real-time, according to the
selected Screen Time. There are many run-time options here:

 [  Run  ] runs the interpolated curve in real-time.
 [ Align ] aligns the move to either the start or end position.
 [Overide] overides the starting position with the Joystick.

The main difference between Run and Align is whether to move the motors
along the curve in real-time, or in a straight line at maximum speed.
A more subtle, yet important difference is that the real-time curve
will only move by "relative" coordinates, whereas Align will insure
positioning by "absolute" coordinates.
  
The Forward/Reverse button options will select which way through the
interpolated curve to move; ie, starting at the first key-frame point,
or the last key-frame point.

The Stop-Motion option will allow you to move through the curve
an increment at a time, from point to point. The Joystick's
pushbutton will act as a remote cue for incrementing through
the move here.

When Running the move in real-time (Continuous option), hitting any
key on the keyboard will immediately kill all motor motion.
Therefore the Spacebar is a good key to use as a "panic button" stop.
Otherwise, wait for the move to come to completion before continuing
with the program.

.topic RunAlign=4300
 Run | Alignment
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Runs the Alignment procedure for locating the motor axes'
reference positions. This procedure runs each of the motors
into a limit switch position, and then counts back to a
pre-determined mid-travel position. Once all selected axes are
aligned into these reference positions, they are zeroed there.
(The position coordinates = 0.)

Axes may be re-zeroed for adjusted alignment positions.
After the alignment procedure finishes, you may re-position any axis
with an Overide operation. Then you can use the [ Zero ] command
to re-zero the axis at the new alignment position. The alignment data
in the {Util | Alignment:UtilAlign} menu is updated automatically.

.topic Overide=4400
 Run | Overide
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Overides running of the motors using the {Joystick:Joystick}.
Each of the motors X,Y,Z, and R may selectively be de-activated via the
check-box buttons in the dialog window.
The current position coordinates (in terms of User Units) are
displayed in the dialog window. They are only valid when the
Joystick has released control of the motors, and the motors
have stopped moving.

.topic Joystick=4500
 Joystick
  ßßßßßßßßß
Runs the motors with the hand-held Joystick assembly.
The Joystick assembly acts as a remote control to the motion control
electronics. Therefore, either the Joystick or the computer may have
control of the motion control system, but not both at the same time.

One of the Joystick elements controls the X and Y axes.
The other one (closest to the interconnection cable) controls the Z and R
axes.

The red pushbutton switch provides remote "cues" for different
parts of the program. Most of the time it acts like an on/off switch
for grabbing and releasing control of the motors for Overide motion.
While in {Run | Plot:RunPlot},
it will also cue the computer to Plot the key-frame points.
While in {Run | Real-Time:RunReal},
it will optionally cue the computer to Run through the interpolated points.
Any time the computer recognizes any of these remote cues, you should
hear a beep.

.topic RunStop=4600
 Run | Stop-Motion
  ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
Runs the interpolated move in stop-motion, according to the
selected Screen Time.

 [  Run  ] runs the interpolated curve in stop-motion.
 [ Align ] aligns the move to either the start or end position.
 [Overide] overides the starting position with the Joystick.

The Forward/Reverse button options will select which way through the
interpolated curve to move; ie, starting at the first key-frame point,
or the last key-frame point.

The Automatic/Single-Frame button will allow you to move through the curve
an increment at a time, with pauses inbetween frames.
The keyboard spacebar may be used as the single-frame advance button.
